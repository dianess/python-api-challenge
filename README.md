python-api-challenge

In this challenge, I created random numbers for latitude and longitude. Using citypy and those latitudes/longitudes, I found the nearest city. Using that city list, I went to openweathermap.org and gathered weather information (maximum temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness) to see if there is any correlation between those and the latitude.
